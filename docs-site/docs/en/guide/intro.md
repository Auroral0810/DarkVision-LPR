::: info Note
**DarkVision-LPR** is a high-precision license plate recognition system designed specifically for **low-light environments**.
:::

Ideally suited for complex lighting scenarios such as nights, underground garages, and tunnels, we utilize the **YOLOv11m** deep learning model combined with the **Retinex image enhancement algorithm**. Trained on over **30,000 images** from the CCPD2019 and CCPD2020 datasets, the model achieves an accuracy of up to **99.9%**.

## Background

License Plate Recognition (LPR) is a key technology in intelligent transportation systems. However, traditional LPR systems often perform poorly in low-light conditions, leading to missed or false detections. To address this pain point, the DeepVision team developed **DarkVision-LPR** to provide reliable recognition capabilities in extreme lighting environments.

## Core Features

- 🌑 **Night Vision Enhancement**: Adaptive image enhancement algorithm (Retinex) makes license plates clearly visible even in extremely dark environments.
- ⚡ **Millisecond Recognition**: Based on the high-performance YOLOv11m (Medium) model, enabling real-time streaming detection.
- 📊 **Data Insights**: Built-in powerful data analysis dashboard for real-time monitoring of recognition traffic, vehicle type distribution, and KPI metrics.
- 🌐 **Full-Stack Ecosystem**: Includes User Portal, Admin Dashboard, and Official Website to meet the needs of different roles.
- 🔒 **Enterprise Security**: Supports real-name authentication, JWT authorization, and operation log auditing.

## Use Cases

- 🏙️ **Urban Security**: Nighttime road monitoring, checkpoint capturing.
- 🅿️ **Smart Parking**: Underground parking lots, multi-story garages with insufficient lighting.
- 🛣️ **Highway Tolling**: Tunnel entrances/exits, vehicle recognition in adverse weather conditions.
